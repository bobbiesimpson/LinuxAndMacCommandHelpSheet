This git repo contains a tex file for generating the pdf of the commonly used commands for Linux and Mac OS. 

I have created this document gradually over time, adding bits here and there since I am of the philosophy that if I write something down immediately, I will be much better off in the future. You see, I'm quite forgetful of all the commmands. 

Since I use a Mac most of the time there is a bias towards commands for this platform.
